## 2. Quick Start: Placing Your First Design

Follow these three steps to get your image on the canvas.

1. **Create:** Open the **Overlays** tab and click `+ Add`.
2. **Upload:** In the **Editor** tab, paste an image URL or pick a file from your computer.
3. **Position:**
   1. After picking your image, it asks you to set its position.
   2. Done! Your overlay is now locked in place.

### Changing Position

1. Click the **Set Position: OFF** button (it will turn **ON**).
2. Click the exact pixel on the game canvas where the **top-left corner** of your image should go.

## 3. Main Controls

Quickly manage how you view the game and your template.

- **Overlay: ON/OFF:** Toggles your template visibility.
- **Mode:**
  - *Minify (Recommended):* Shows your design as dashes or unique symbol patterns for each color, so you can see the canvas below.
    > You can choose between two minify styles in the **Tools** tab.
  - *Behind/Above:* Shows the full image behind or on top of pixels.
  - *Original:* Hides the overlay to view the raw canvas.
- **Show Errors:** Highlights incorrect pixels in **red**.
- **Set Position:** Reactivates the positioning tool to move your overlay.
