# VoX - Overlay Pro: A Complete User Guide -_-/
**Based on shinkonet's code, adapted and enhanced for Wplace.**
This guide is translated to English from SrCratier's build using DeepL.

Welcome to **VoX - Overlay Pro**!  
This guide will help you master all the tools that the script makes available to you, from placing your first design to using the most advanced features for coordination and planning.

## **1. Installation**

To use the script, you first need a browser extension called **Tampermonkey**.

1. Install Tampermonkey:

**IMPORTANT: FOR PHONES, IT ONLY WORKS WITH THE MICROSOFT EDGE BROWSER - ADD THE EXTENSION FROM THE MENU**

   - [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
   - [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
   - [Other browsers](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

2. Install the Script:  
    Once you have Tampermonkey, simply go to the Release page on GitHub and click on https://github.com/Lamechial/Wplace_VoX-Overlay-Pro/releases/download/v4.9.2/WplacePro-VoX.user-English.js or the **WplacePro-VoX.user.English.js** file.  
    Tampermonkey will open automatically and ask you to install the script.

## **2. Your First Overlay: The Essential Steps**

This is the main function of the script. Follow these steps to place your first design on the canvas.

**Step 1: Create a New Overlay**  
In the script panel, go to the **Overlays** tab and click the **+ Add** button. This will create a new space for your image.

**Step 2: Add Your Image**  
With the new overlay selected, go to the **Editor** tab. You have two ways to add your image:
- **From a URL:** Paste a direct link to an image (.png, .jpg, etc.) into the text field and click **Upload**. 
- **From a Local File:** Click the dotted box or drag and drop an image file from your computer.  
*(Note: Overlays with local images cannot be exported or shared with others).*

**Step 3: Set the Position (The most important step!)**  
Once the image is uploaded, the script needs to know where to place it on the canvas.
1. Click **Set Position: OFF** button to activate it. It will change to **Set Position: ON**.  
2. Go to the game canvas and click on the exact pixel that corresponds to the upper left corner (0,0) of your image.  
3. Done! The script will set the image at that coordinate. **Set Position** mode will automatically be deactivated.

## **3. The Main Panel: An Overview**

The interface is designed to be powerful yet intuitive. Here is an overview of the main controls:

- **Overlay: ON/OFF** → Enables or disables the display of all your overlays.
- **Mode: Minify** → Changes how the overlay is displayed:
   - *Minify (Recommended):* Displays your design as a grid of dots, allowing you to see the canvas underneath.
   - *Behind/Above:* Displays the entire image behind or in front of the canvas.
   - *Original:* Does not modify the canvas, ideal for viewing the actual state of the mural.
- **Show Errors: ON/OFF** → Highlights pixels on the canvas that do not match your design in red.
- **Set Position: ON/OFF** → Activates the mode to set the position of your image on the canvas again.
